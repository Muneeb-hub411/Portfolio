          I am a passionate software engineer with a strong background in web
          development, having graduated from SS CASE IT in Islamabad. Over the
          past two years, I have worked extensively as a junior web developer at
          022 Marketing Agency and IT Verticals, where I played a pivotal role
          in creating and managing a variety of websites tailored to different
          client needs. My core expertise lies in the MERN stack and WordPress,
          which allows me to develop full-stack applications and user-friendly
          content management systems. From dynamic eCommerce platforms to
          customized websites, I have honed my ability to translate business
          requirements into functional, aesthetically pleasing digital
          experiences. My experience working with US-based companies has exposed
          me to global standards and the importance of delivering scalable,
          high-performance solutions. Whether working on the front-end or
          back-end, I always aim to innovate, staying at the forefront of
          technology trends to ensure that every project I work on exceeds
          expectations. My commitment to quality and my continuous learning
          mindset drive me to solve complex problems with precision and
          creativity.
